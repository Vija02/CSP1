Computer science project 1

This project is a modification from:

PROJECT TITLE: Horstmann's Nifty Greenfoot Picture World (with extensions by Barbara Ericson)
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Guzdial/Ericson style image manipulation
VERSION or DATE: Sept 16, 2010
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Edit MyPicture.java to add new image manipulation methods (see the current ones
as examples).  You can create new methods that set all the blue values to 0, or copy the colors from the pixels on the 
right side of the picture to the left, etc.  Call the new method in the act method.  The act method will let you pick the 
image file and then will run the image manipulation method repainting every so often to show you the way 
it changes the picture. Try changing the act method to call different image manipulation methods one
at a time to see how they each work.  The Picture class lets you get all the pixels in a picture in a 
one-dimensional array in row-major order(using getPixels()).  It also lets you get all the pixesl in a 
picture in a two-dimensional array in either row-major or column-major order (using getPixels2DRowMajor() or 
getPixels2D()).

AUTHORS: Cay Horstmann and Barbara Ericson
USER INSTRUCTIONS:

Follow the instructions given above. Or, just to play.  Right click on the default image and 
select the pick method from the Picture superclass.  Pick an image file. (Don't 
have one handy? Pick "images/The Road.jpg").  Then execute one of the methods in MyPicture.  
You can select the reload method in Picture to reset the picture to the contents of the file.
